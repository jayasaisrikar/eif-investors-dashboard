# Example environment variables for eif-investors-dash
# Copy this file to `.env` locally and fill in real values. Do NOT commit
# real secrets to your repository.

# --- Server runtime ---
# Port the server listens on (used by `server/index.ts`). Default: 5000
PORT=5000

# Host to bind the server to. On Windows you may want `127.0.0.1`.
HOST=127.0.0.1

# Node environment. Set to `production` in production builds.
NODE_ENV=development

# Deployment domain used by meta image plugin at build time to construct
# absolute OpenGraph / twitter image URLs (used by `vite-plugin-meta-images`).
# Example: https://dash.example.com
DEPLOYMENT_URL=

# --- Supabase (server-side) ---
# This project uses Supabase as the primary and only storage backend.
# SUPABASE_URL is the project URL (https://<project>.supabase.co)
SUPABASE_URL=

# Service role key (server-only) - required for server-side operations.
# Keep this secret and never expose to client builds or public repos.
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# Optional: legacy key variable name. The server will accept this if provided.
SUPABASE_KEY=

# Optional: If you want client-side access (e.g. in-browser read-only operations),
# add an anon key prefixed for Vite so it is exposed to the client bundle. Only
# add this if you understand the security implications (anon keys are safe for
# public use but are not suitable for privileged operations).
# Vite client key example (client-side):
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

# JWT signing secret used to create authentication tokens. Keep this secret.
# Example: a long random string. Required for login endpoint.
JWT_SECRET=

# --- Notes / guidance ---
# - For local development on Windows, set HOST=127.0.0.1 to avoid ENOTSUP errors
#   related to socket options (see server/README.md).
# - Do NOT expose service role keys to the browser. If you need a client-side
#   Supabase anon key, add it to the client as a Vite-prefixed variable, e.g.
#   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and reference it in client code via
#   `import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
# - Any env vars that should be available to the client build must use the
#   `VITE_` prefix (e.g. `VITE_APP_BASE_URL`). This project currently has no
#   required client-exposed env vars out-of-the-box.

# --- Example PowerShell usage ---
# $env:SUPABASE_URL = "https://your-project.supabase.co"
# $env:SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = "your-service-role-key"
# $env:DATABASE_URL = "postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db"
# npm run dev
